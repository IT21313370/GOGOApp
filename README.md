A to-do list with CRUD operations allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Users can add tasks with a name and location, along with any relevant details or due dates. They can also view their tasks, edit them, mark them as complete, or delete them altogether.

To make it easier for users to find specific tasks, the to-do list also includes a search functionality. This search feature allows users to search for tasks by name or location. Users can simply type in a keyword or phrase, and the search feature will return any matching results.

Additionally, the to-do list has a payment calculation feature that is shown at the top of the page. This feature calculates the total cost of all the tasks on the to-do list based on various factors, such as time required or location. Users can easily see the total cost of their tasks, which helps them budget and plan accordingly.

Overall, this to-do list with CRUD operations, search functionality, and payment calculation feature is designed to help users stay organized and on top of their tasks while also providing them with important information about their project's cost.
