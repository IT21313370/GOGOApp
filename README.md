To make it easier for users to find specific tasks, the to-do list also includes a search functionality. This search feature allows users to search for tasks by name or location. Users can simply type in a keyword or phrase, and the search feature will return any matching results.

Additionally, the to-do list has a payment calculation feature that is shown at the top of the page. This feature calculates the total cost of all the tasks on the to-do list based on various factors, such as time required or location. Users can easily see the total cost of their tasks, which helps them budget and plan accordingly.
